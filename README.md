# Energy Efficiency and CO2 Emissions Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between energy efficiency, building characteristics, and CO2 emissions. The dataset contains information on various factors that impact energy usage and emissions, such as insulation, wall size, construction year, and regional variations.

## Visualizations and Insights

### 1. Larger Walls and Energy Loss
**File:** `larger_walls_energy_loss_analysis.png`
- Examines whether larger wall areas lead to higher CO2 emissions.
- The scatter plot suggests that larger walls might contribute to increased energy loss, but other factors such as insulation quality also play a role.

### 2. Heat Loss Through Roofs
**File:** `heat_loss_through_roof_trends.png`
- Investigates how roof insulation (U-Value) affects energy efficiency.
- A lower U-Value indicates better insulation, and the data suggests that better-insulated roofs contribute to lower emissions.

### 3. Impact of Wall Insulation on Emissions
**File:** `impact_of_wall_insulation_on_emissions.png`
- Analyzes the correlation between wall insulation and CO2 emissions.
- Buildings with better-insulated walls (lower U-Value) generally exhibit reduced emissions, reinforcing the importance of effective insulation.

### 4. Heating-Related Emissions Over Time
**File:** `heating_emissions_trends_over_time.png`
- Tracks heating-related emissions across different construction periods.
- Modern buildings tend to have lower emissions due to improved building standards and energy-efficient materials.

### 5. Energy Efficiency Improvement Over the Years
**File:** `energy_efficiency_improvement_over_years.png`
- Examines whether energy efficiency has improved with time.
- The data suggests a clear downward trend in energy usage for heating, reflecting advancements in energy-saving technologies.

### 6. Regions with the Most Energy Consumption
**File:** `highest_energy_consumption_regions.png`
- Displays a comparison of total energy used for heating by region.
- Some counties and cities exhibit significantly higher energy consumption, potentially due to older buildings or climate conditions.

### 7. Top Regions with the Best Energy Ratings
**File:** `top_regions_with_best_energy_ratings.png`
- Highlights regions with the highest average Building Energy Rating (BER).
- Certain areas perform significantly better, possibly due to newer housing stock and stricter building regulations.

### 8. County-Wise CO2 Emissions Distribution
**File:** `countywise_co2_emissions_distribution.png`
- Analyzes CO2 emissions at the county level.
- Regions with higher emissions may have older infrastructure or higher energy demands.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights the critical role of insulation, construction standards, and regional factors in determining energy efficiency and CO2 emissions. By improving insulation and adopting energy-efficient practices, significant reductions in emissions can be achieved.
